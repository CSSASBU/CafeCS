Each week, we bring together students, developers, mathematicians, and enthusiasts to explore ideas across CS: from algorithms and theory to AI, software engineering, hardware, and everything in between.\nOur goal is simple: create a warm, welcoming space where people can learn from one another, think together, and enjoy the process of understanding complex ideas — all without the pressure of a classroom or the formality of a conference. Just thoughtful minds, good vibes, and interesting discussions.\nThis is our team:\n\n.team-container {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  justify-content: center;\n  gap: 2em;\n  margin-top: 2em;\n}\n\n.member {\n  flex: 1 1 200px; /* responsive width — fits 2-3 per row */\n  max-width: 300px;\n  text-align: center;\n  padding: 1em;\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  transition: transform 0.2s ease, box-shadow 0.2s ease;\n}\n\n.member:hover {\n  transform: translateY(-5px);\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\n}\n\n.member img {\n  width: 100%;\n  max-width: 180px;\n  height: 180px;\n  object-fit: cover;\n  border-radius: 50%; /* makes images round */\n  margin-bottom: 1em;\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);\n}\n\n.member .name {\n  font-weight: bold;\n  font-size: 1.1em;\n  margin-bottom: 0.3em;\n}\n\n\n.member .title {\n  font-size: 0.9em;\n}\n\n/* Responsive adjustments */\n@media (max-width: 700px) {\n  .member {\n    flex: 1 1 100%;\n  }\n}\n\n\n  \n    \n    Sadra Seyedtabaei\n  \n\n    \n    Mohammad Sajjad Zanganeh\n  \n  \n    \n    Amin Ghoorchian\n  \n  \n    \n    Shayan Shahrabi\n  \n  \n    \n    Ali Taherzadeh\n  \n  \n    \n    Mehrdad Shirvani\n  \n  \n    \n    Ali Nadi\n  \n  \n    \n    AmirAli Araghi\n  \n  \n    \n    Ehsan Habibagahi\n  \n  \n    \n    Hirad Torabi\n  \n"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"Home","links":["talks/1404-08-28-Fun-Meets-Function/notes","talks/1404-08-28-Fun-Meets-Function/slides.pdf","talks/1404-08-21-Beyond-The-Bank/notes","talks/1404-08-21-Beyond-The-Bank/slides.pdf","talks/1404-08-14-Who-Is-Guarding-the-Louvre/notes","talks/1404-08-14-Who-Is-Guarding-the-Louvre/slides.pdf"],"tags":["webinar","computer-science","community","shahid-beheshti-university"],"content":"☕ Café CS\n🎙 Upcoming &amp; Past Talks\n\n\t.table-container {\n\t  width: 100%;\n\t  overflow-x: hidden;\n\t  box-sizing: border-box;\n\t}\n\t\n\ttable {\n\t  width: 90%;\n\t  table-layout: auto; \n\t  border-collapse: collapse;\n\t  margin: auto;\n\t}\n\t\n\ttd, th {\n\t  word-wrap: break-word;\n\t  overflow-wrap: break-word;\n\t  white-space: normal;\n\t  border: 1px solid #ccc;\n\t  padding: 1em;\n\t}\n\ttd:first-child {\n\t  vertical-align: middle;\n\t}\n\tth {\n\t  background-color: #222;\n\t  color: #eee;\n\t  text-align: left;\n\t  \n\t}\n\t\n\ttd img {\n\t  width: 100%;\n\t  max-height: 2000px; \n\t  object-fit:scale-down;\n\t  border-radius: 8px;\n\t  display: block;\n\t}\n\t\n\ttr {\n\t  height: auto;         \n\t  object-fit: contain;\n\t\n\t}\n\t\n\t.title {\n\t  font-weight: bold;\n\t  font-size: 1.1em;\n\t}\n\t\n\t.tags {\n\t  margin-top: 0.5em;\n\t  display: flex;\n\t  flex-wrap: wrap;\n\t  gap: 0.3em;\n\t}\n\t\n\t.tag {\n\t  background: #445;\n\t  color: #ccd;\n\t  padding: 0.2em 0.5em;\n\t  border-radius: 5px;\n\t  font-size: 0.85em;\n\t}\n\t\n\t.description {\n\t  margin-top: 0.5em;\n\t  font-size: 0.9em;\n\t  color: #AAA;\n\t}\n\t\n\t.resources {\n\t  margin-top: 0.8em;\n\t}\n\t\n\t.resources strong {\n\t  display: block;\n\t  margin-bottom: 0.3em;\n\t  \n\t}\n\t\n\t.resources a {\n\t  display: inline-block;\n\t  margin-right: 0.8em;\n\t  color: #66aaff;\n\t  text-decoration: none;\n\t}\n\t\n\t.resources a:hover {\n\t  text-decoration: underline;\n\t}\n\t\n\t/* Responsive stacking */\n\t@media (max-width: 700px) {\n\n  /* Make each row a card */\n  tr {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: column;\n    border: 1px solid #333;\n    border-radius: 10px;\n    margin-bottom: 1.5em;\n    overflow: hidden;\n  }\n\n  thead {\n    display: none;\n  }\n\n  td {\n    display: block;\n    width: 100%;\n    border: none;\n    padding: 1em;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n  }\n\n  /* Image becomes full-width */\n  td img {\n    width: 100%;\n    height: auto;\n    max-height: none;   /* important */\n    object-fit: contain;\n    display: block;\n  }\n\n  .table-container {\n    padding: 0 .5em;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        Poster\n        Talk Info\n      \n    \n    \n    \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            #003: Fun Meets Function\n             | When Games Get Serious !\n          \n          Mehrdad Shirvani\n          \n            Nov 20, 2025\n            games\n            serious-games\n            gamification\n            learning\n            creativity\n            innovation\n            problem-solving\n            motivation\n            human-intuition\n            behavioral-science\n          \n          \n            Games are shaping the way we learn, solve problems, and innovate.

A corner café where we talk about the very foundation beans of CS - from machine learning and artificial intelligence to software &amp; hardware engineering, mathematics, graph theory, and anything roasted, brewed, or filtered through the world of computer science.\nHere, once a week, we gather - tea in hand, curiosity online, engines engaged - to discuss what we love.\nThese sessions aren’t meant to be a class - nor a conference. No towering lecture halls. No rigid protocols. Just a warm, friendly café chat for inquisitive minds - to learn from one another, spark ideas, and build a cozy fellowship of computer enthusiasts.\nTill we meet again, fellow travelers of logic… 🙌❤️☕\n\n[!tip] [Café CS](AboutUs) - More Than a Gathering. A Brewed Alliance.\n\n"},"talks/1404-08-14-Who-Is-Guarding-the-Louvre/notes":{"slug":"talks/1404-08-14-Who-Is-Guarding-the-Louvre/notes","filePath":"talks/1404-08-14-Who-Is-Guarding-the-Louvre/notes.md","title":"notes","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Who’s Guarding the Louvre?! : The Art Gallery Problem Explained\n\n\n                  \n                  Presenter: Shayan Shahrabi \n                  \n                \n\n\nOverview: Imagine securing an art gallery with the fewest guards possible.
