By harnessing human intuition and motivation, we’ll see how the mechanics that make games engaging can also turn them into powerful engines for real-world impact.\n          \n          \n            Resources:  \n            Slides\n            Lecture Notes\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Beyond the Bank\n               What is Bitcoin &amp; Why?!\n          \n          Seyed Ali Hosseini Nasab\n          \n            Nov 13, 2025\n            bitcoin\n            blockchain\n            decentralized-systems\n            cryptography\n            digital-money\n            peer-to-peer\n            finance\n            technology\n          \n          \n            From obscurity to global headlines, Bitcoin has sparked a financial revolution that challenges our deepest assumptions about money. But what truly lies beneath the digital surface? This presentation goes beyond the price tag to uncover the core innovation: a decentralized system that allows us to trust each other without needing to trust a middleman. We will unravel how Bitcoin creates digital scarcity and enables peer-to-peer value transfer across the globe, exploring its emergence as &quot;digital gold&quot; and its potential to redefine the future of finance.\n          \n          \n            Resources:  \n            Slides\n            Lecture Notes\n          \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            Who is Guarding the Louvre?!\n            The Art Gallery Problem Explained\n          \n          Shayan Shahrabi Farahani\n\t\n          \n\t        Nov 6, 2025\n            computational-geometry\n            optimization\n            visibility\n            algorithms\n            geometry\n            problem-solving\n            theory\n            math\n          \n          \n            Imagine securing an art gallery with the fewest guards possible. This is the essence of the Art Gallery Problem, a classic puzzle in computational geometry that challenges us to find the optimal way to cover a space. It&#039;s all about achieving maximum visibility with minimum resources. Our goal for this session is to unravel this problem together, from its initial setup to its surprising and intuitive solution.\n          \n          \n            Resources:\n            Slides\n            Lecture Notes\n          \n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nAbout Us\nMany events inspired us to ignite the engines of Café CS - from the legendary series of Combinatorics Circle Seminars organized by the minds behind Iran’s Combinatorics Olympiad, to the Tabaghe16 Podcast of Soheil Alavi, which - by his own words - brews a magnetism that gathers people who think alike… and see the world through the same lens.\nWe even took a sip from past experiences - like the Math Circle Book - a place where people gathered around a shared table and solved problems together… much like a group of heroes plotting strategy over steaming mugs of logic.\nAll these sparks combined - and forged the idea that we, too, should ignite our own gathering - a place where computer scientists, tech lovers, mathematicians, and curious spirits unite. A corner café where we talk about the very foundation beans of CS - from machine learning and artificial intelligence to software &amp; hardware engineering, mathematics, graph theory, and anything roasted, brewed, or filtered through the world of computer science.\nHere, once a week, we gather - tea in hand, curiosity online, engines engaged - to discuss what we love.\nThese sessions aren’t meant to be a class - nor a conference. No towering lecture halls. No rigid protocols. Just a warm, friendly café chat for inquisitive minds - to learn from one another, spark ideas, and build a cozy fellowship of computer enthusiasts.\nTill we meet again, fellow travelers of logic… 🙌❤️☕\n\n\n                  \n                  Café CS - More Than a Gathering.
