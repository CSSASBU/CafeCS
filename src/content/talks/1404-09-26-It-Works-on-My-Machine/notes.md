> **Overview:** Before Docker, deploying software meant uncertainty, manual setup, and the infamous “it works on my machine” problem. Docker didn’t just introduce containers; it introduced reproducibility, portability, and a new way of thinking about software. In this talk, we’ll explore:
>  - How Docker was born and why the industry needed it 
>  - The technical ideas behind containers (without the boring parts) 
>  - How Docker reshaped team workflows, DevOps culture, and developer mindset 
>  - And why Docker is less about technology, and more about how we collaborate
