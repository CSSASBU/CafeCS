> **Overview:** We live in an era where data is generated at unprecedented speed, volume, and variety—a phenomenon widely known as Big Data . This explosion of information has fundamentally changed how organizations store, process, and analyze their digital assets.
> In this lecture we'll explore the evolution from traditional Data Warehouses (structured storage for analytics) to flexible Data Lakes (raw data repositories), and innovative Data Lakehouses (combining the best of both). Finally, we'll discuss real-time stream processing.
