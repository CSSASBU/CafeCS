# ☕ Café CS

[Visit Café CS](https://cssasbu.github.io/CafeCS/)

Many events inspired us to ignite the engines of Café CS - from the legendary series of Combinatorics Circle Seminars organized by the minds behind Iran’s Combinatorics Olympiad, to the Tabaghe16 Podcast of Soheil Alavi, which - by his own words - brews a magnetism that gathers people who think alike… and see the world through the same lens.

We even took a sip from past experiences - like the Math Circle Book - a place where people gathered around a shared table and solved problems together… much like a group of heroes plotting strategy over steaming mugs of logic.

All these sparks combined - and forged the idea that we, too, should ignite our own gathering - a place where computer scientists, tech lovers, mathematicians, and curious spirits unite. A corner café where we talk about the very foundation beans of CS - from machine learning and artificial intelligence to software & hardware engineering, mathematics, graph theory, and anything roasted, brewed, or filtered through the world of computer science.

Here, once a week, we gather - tea in hand, curiosity online, engines engaged - to discuss what we love.

These sessions aren’t meant to be a class - nor a conference. No towering lecture halls. No rigid protocols. Just a warm, friendly café chat for inquisitive minds - to learn from one another, spark ideas, and build a cozy fellowship of computer enthusiasts.

Till we meet again, fellow travelers of logic… 🙌❤️☕

Café CS - More Than a Gathering. A Brewed Alliance.
